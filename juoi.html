			<h2>Content</h2>
			<p>Social media has made it easier than ever to access a wide range of content, from news and entertainment to educational resources and personal connections. However, this abundance of content can also be overwhelming, leading to information overload and difficulty discerning what is reliable and accurate.</p>
		    <h1>What are the effects of social media on teenagers</h1>
			<p>One of the most well known effects that social media has on teenagers is that it can disrupt their sleep which will inhibit them from doing well in school or any other place of study.Social media will also play a major role in someone's ability to focus depending on the duration of time they spend on there daily.Speaking from experience i know for a fact that when i spend hours and hours on social media im not able to really focus on the tasks at hand after getting off of it all i think about is getting back on it.But there are ways to overcome these problems it's all about the mindset in all honesty.

			<h2>Choice</h2>
            <p>Social media offers users a vast array of choices, from which platforms to use and which accounts to follow, to what content to engage with and how to present themselves online. However, this abundance of choice can also lead to decision fatigue and feelings of inadequacy and FOMO (fear of missing out).</p>
            <img src="social-media-choice.jpg" alt="Social media choice">
            <p>To mitigate the negative effects of social media choice, it is important to set healthy boundaries and prioritize your own well-being and values. This may involve limiting your social media use, unfollowing accounts that do not align with your values or make you feel bad about yourself, and practicing self-care and mindfulness.</p>
